## How to use 

* **Overleaf**: if you want the long resume version, upload the files `resume.cls`,`long.tex` and `biblio.bib` as a .zip file to Overleaf; otherwise, upload the `resume.cls`, `short.tex` and `bibshort.bib`. 
* **Local**: assuming a full LaTeX installation, simply run `pdflatex {long or short}.tex` on the command line to get a `{long or short}.pdf` output; maybe you need to twice if you have a .bib file idk I just use Overleaf.
